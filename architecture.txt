Architecure: 

I use mostly Vue and Django. But i have experience 1 YOE in React and Node.js and i know how it works (used React and Express.js on two of my failed products)

1. Frontend 
    - pages/ - index.vue, [id].vue 
    - Reusable components 
    - Main store for state management. 
    - In store we have actions, getters
    - js files for API's

2. Backend 
    - I use layered service architecture 
    - So we have different layers
        REST API - contact with the outside world
            - External-facing API endpoints 
            - This is the connection between frontend and backend 
            - Validation, Error handling
            - Authentication and authorization
            - Security middleware
            - Input validation and sanitization 
        Internal API 
            - Internal routing and orchestration 
            - Internal API is for communication between REST API and service layer. This is used between "teams" of developers, so that the service is not a black box.
            - Validation, Error handling 
        Service layer
            - Where business logic resides and client interactions are managed 
            - Main Business logic. 
            - It is used for everything that relates to logic, it returns from database, creates tasks, call clients (3rd party service).
            Data Access Layer (Models)
                - Database models and queries
                - Handles data persistence and retrieval
                - Defines database schema and relationships
        Utility/Helper Layer
            - Common utilities and helper functions
            - Shared functionality across layers
            - Configuration management
        External Services Integration Layer (CLIENTS)
            - Handles communication with third-party services
            - API clients (OpenAI, VoyageAI, etc.)
            - Service adapters and interfaces
